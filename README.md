# Utilities
This utility is created to help getting information and validate the formats of veritas numbers.

## Norwegian social security number (Fødselsnummer)
A Norwegian social security number (Fødselsnummer) contains veritas information. The Information that can be gotten except for if it is validly formatted is Date of Birth, year of birth (including century), Gender and the type of number (normal, D-number or H-Number). This dose not support FH numbers because it is used by the The healthcare system for uniq identification and dose not follow a person out side of the health system.

For more detailed information about the [Norwegian social security number (Fødselsnummer) go here](Utilities/SocialSecurityNumber.md).


P.S.
The tests in this project are not perfect an can be improved, but it shows a bit of how I feel what a liberty should contain.
