# Utilities
This utility is created to help getting information and validate the formats of veritas numbers.

## Norwegian Social Security Number (Fødselsnummer) Utility
A Norwegian social security number (Fødselsnummer) contains veritas information. The Information that can be gotten except for if it is validly formatted is Date of Birth, year of birth (including century), Gender and the type of number (normal, D-number or H-Number). This dose not support FH numbers because it is used by the The healthcare system for uniq identification and dose not follow a person out side of the health system.

## Norwegian Bank Account Number Utility
This utility is built to validate if a Norwegian bank account number is in the correct format including control digit validation. It is also built to get witch bank the Account number belongs to.

P.S.
The tests in this project are not perfect an can probably be improved, but it shows a bit of how I feel what a liberty should contain.
